## Supported Commands

### Single Channel Scrape

    /scr @channel_username 1000
    ```

    ```text
    /scr -1001234567890 1000
    ```

5. Use an invite link for private channels:

    ```text

    ```

### Multi Channel Scrape

    ```text
    /mc @channel_username @channel_username1 1000
    ```

    /mc -1001234567890 -1009876543210 1000
    ```

3. For private channels using invite links with the `/mc` command:

    ```text
    /mc https://t.me/+abcdef1234567890 https://t.me/+uvwxyz9876543210 1000
    ```

### General Notes

- The `@channel_username` can be replaced with the actual username of the channel or group.
- The `-1001234567890` should be replaced with the actual chat ID of the private channel or group.
- The `https://t.me/+abcdef1234567890` should be replaced with the actual invite link of the private channel or group.
- The `1000` represents the number of messages to scrape and can be adjusted as needed.
- For multi-channel scrape (`/mc`), the last argument should always be the total number of messages to scrape across all specified channels.

## Major Note
**DEFAULT_LIMIT** Currently Set To 5000 Because Request Over 10000 May Cause Your User Acc `Ban Or Logout`
**ADMIN_LIMIT** Currently Set To 10000 Because Request Over 10000 May Cause Your User Acc `Ban Or Logout`

✨ **Notes**:
- Ensure the bot is an administrator in the channels/groups you want to scrape from for the best results.
- The bot can handle a high number of requests simultaneously, but it's a good practice to monitor its performance and adjust limits if necessary.
- If you encounter any issues, check the bot logs for detailed error messages.
- Keep your API credentials and session string secure to prevent unauthorized access to your bot.
- First Clone Repo Then Update Credentials Dont Direct Commit On Github To  Keep Credentials Secure.
